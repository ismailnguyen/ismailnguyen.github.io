## Getting started with SvelteJS v3

This is a simple starter template for building and running an app using [Svelte](https://v3.svelte.technology). To get going, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your machine.

Next, `cd` to the directory where this project has been cloned...

```
git clone https://github.com/Holben888/svelte-starter-template.git
cd ./svelte-starter-template
```

...install all project dependencies...

```
npm install
```

...and build the application.

```
npm run build
```

This should pull up a page in your favorite web browser saying "I'm an app!"
If you look at the file `rollup.config.js` in your text editor, you should see imports for "live-reload" and "serve." These allow the website to rebuild itself automatically when you add new code, and refresh the page in your browser so you can see your changes.

Go visit the [documentation page](https://svelte.dev/docs) for SvelteJS to start building! :smiley:
