## Build

```
git clone https://github.com/ismailnguyen/ismailnguyen.github.io.git
cd ./ismailnguyen.github.io
```

...install all project dependencies...

```
npm install
```

...and build the application.

```
npm run build
```

This should pull up a page in your favorite web browser saying "I'm an app!"
If you look at the file `rollup.config.js` in your text editor, you should see imports for "live-reload" and "serve." These allow the website to rebuild itself automatically when you add new code, and refresh the page in your browser so you can see your changes. 

## Next steps

Go visit the [documentation page](https://svelte.dev/docs) for SvelteJS to start building! :smiley:
